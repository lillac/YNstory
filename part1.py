You can try to describe it, terrifying? maybe.  If only it was within reach, to feel that fraction of a second again. The light fading away, the heavy weight of the ocean above you. How your lungs slowly collapsed from pressure. Strangely calm, a moment of peace. Content. As if the world had frozen; for just for a moment in time, I felt at ease with the universe.\nJust one moment, that was enough...")
